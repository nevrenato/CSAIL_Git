	<h3>What is a VCS</h3>
	<p> A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that records changes on your 
	files over time. The main idea is to keep track of the changes on your files 
	and to retrieve them later. There are mainly three kinds of version control system: 
	local, centralized and distributed. On a local VCS it is not possible to collaborate 
	with other users and the structure that keeps track of the files is kept only locally. 
	The need for collaborations with other users brought the centralized VCS. 
	On the centralized version control systems there exists a server that keeps track of the 
	changes on the files and each user pushes and checks out files from this server. 
	This approach has mainly two problems. 
	The first is to have a single point of failure, if a server goes 
	down during a certain time, nobody can check out or pull updates. 
	The second problem is when you are not connected to the network, you cannot pull or commit your changes. 
	To solve this problems, the distributed VCS appeared. 
	Here each user keeps a mirror of the repository and there is not a central server. 
	An user can always commit and when connected can push/checkout the
	changes. </p>
	<h3>What is Git</h3>
	<p>  
	Git is a distributed VCS. It was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, for the Linux kernel development. 
	The main difference when comparing to others distributed VCS is that Git keeps 
	snapshots of how your system looks like on a certain moment in time instead of keeping track of changes.
