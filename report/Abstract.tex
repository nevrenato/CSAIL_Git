\begin{abstract}
It is unthinkable to think about the world of software with no version
control systems. \emph{Git} was born in 2005 and since then it is having a
great success. The problem is that there are not any formal specification 
about its internals. With this
manual, we try to give a semi-formal specification of \emph{git}
and explain the behavior of some operations. This manual is based on a
formal specification defined using the formal modeling language Alloy.
