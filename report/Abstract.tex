\begin{abstract}
It is unthinkable to think about the world of software with no version
control systems. \emph{Git} was born in 2005 and since then it is having a
great success. The problem is that there are not any formal or even
informal specification about its internals. With this
manual, we try to give a semi-formal specification about \emph{git}
and explain the behavior of some operations. The manual is based on a
model built by us using a modeling tool called \emph{Alloy}.
