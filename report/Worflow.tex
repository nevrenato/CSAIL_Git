\section{Git Workflow}

\subsection{Working Directory}

This is just a temporary checkout place, where we can modify 
the files until the next commit \cite{gitComm} (pag 17).

\subsection{The git Index}

Middle man between the working directory, and the repository.
The index will build up the set of changes for the next
commit. When a commit is created what is commited is what
is in the git Index and not what's in the working directory \cite{gitComm} (pag 25).

\subsection{The git add command}

It's very powerfull, because it's used both for new and newly modified
files, and in both cases it takes a snapshot of the given files
and stages that content in the Index, ready for the inclusion
in the next commit. \cite{gitComm} (page 26)
