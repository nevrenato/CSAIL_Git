\section{Introduction}

In this report, we will try to give a complete specification
of the git core system. \par
We will focus on the following parts :

\begin{enumerate}
\item Object Model
\item Working Directory
\item Index
\end{enumerate}

After the specification of these parts, we will make the
model dynamic, in order to specify git most important operations.

Following this, some assertions on the model will be
introduced, in order
to verify the git robustness and safety. \par
