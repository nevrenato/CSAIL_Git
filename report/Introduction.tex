\section{Introduction}

This project aims to build a precise model of how the git works. \par
The purpose of this model is to check some properties that the model
(not) guarantees.\par
In this report, we will try to give a specification
of the git core system. \par
After the specification process, we will make the
model dynamic, in order to specify git most important operations. \par
Following this, some assertions on the model will be
introduced, in order
to verify the git robustness and safety. \par
Finnaly some conclusions will be presented to the readers.
