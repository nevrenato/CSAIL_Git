\section{Introduction}

This project aims to build a precise model of how the git works. \par
The purpose of this model is to check some properties that the model does
(not) guarantees.\par
In this report, we will try to give a specification
of the git core system. \par
After the specification process, we will make the
model dynamic, in order to specify git most important operations. \par
Following this, some assertions on the model will be
introduced, in order
to verify the git robustness and safety. \par
Finally some conclusions will be presented to the readers.

\subsection{A brief explanation of git}

Git is just one of many \Gls{version control system} available. 
They are 
distinguished by two main types: Centralized and Distributed.
Git it's in the later. The major difference between git and any
other VCS, is that while others save differences between files, git saves
snapshots. \par
A Git project usually has three main sections: Repository, Index and
Working Directory. Where the later it's just a subset of the filesystem. \par
Git was created in 2005 by the Linux community, 
with the purpose of replacing BitKeeper. Some of it's
goals are \cite{progit}: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Speed
	\item Simple design
	\item Strong support for non-linear development
	\item Fully distributed
	\item Able to handle large projects like the Linux Kernel 
	efficently (speed and data size)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Why the verification of git is important}

Nowadays, the software projects are getting bigger, and in most
cases it is needed a version control system. Thus, git is being
more and more used. However, can we trust in git to manage projects
of big value ? We don't know the answer, but it's true that we can be
more confident in git if we make some kind of verification on it. Because
there are no known formal/semiformal verifications of git, we try to fill
part of that hole with this project.
