\chapter{Properties}
After the \emph{git} internals and some operations were modeled,
we checked for some properties. These properties are important to
prove the correct behavior of the model. Such properties were checked using
Alloy Analyzer, which tries to find counter examples for the
properties. This analysis is bounded, which means that it is not a
complete analysis, but instead it analyses the model up to
\emph{''n''} objects.\\

In the next sections we present some properties checked. We start with
the invariant preservation, then we show which operations are
idempotent and then we check for operation specific properties.
