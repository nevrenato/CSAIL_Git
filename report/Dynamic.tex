\section {Modelling Git Dynamic Object Model}

The static object model, only by itself, 
is not very useful. And so
the model would be much more interesting if we specify 
the most important git operations. That said in this
section we will focus on modelling the most important
and critical of them. \par


\subsubsection{The git add command}

This command is one of the most used in git. \cite{gitComm} (page 26)
tells us that
"git add is {\bf used both for new and newly modified files},
and in both cases it takes a snapshot of the given files
and {\bf stages that content in the index, ready for inclusion
in the next commit}." \par 
As already said above a newly modified file, it's tracked by
the Working Directory, so all references to modified files in
the Index must also appear in the Working Directory. For newly
added files that is not the case.

\subsubsection{The git rm command}

This one is generally less used. It's usefullness can be
seen in the following : \cite{progit}
(page 21) says "To remove a file from Git, you have to remove it
from your tracked files (more accurately, {\bf remove it from your
staging area}) and them commit. The {\bf git rm command does that
and also removes the file from your working directory}...". \par
Note that the working directory refered in the citation is not
the git Working Directory, it's the directory of the filesystem itself.
In other words a 'rm <file>' is present inside the 'git rm <file>'. \par
When using git rm
that modification will only appear in the Index. Unless, before
the git rm we delete the file from the filesystem (e.g. rm ). \par
