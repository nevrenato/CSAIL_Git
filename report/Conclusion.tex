\section{Conclusion}
In this project we started by modeling the git internals using Alloy
\cite{Jackson:2006:SAL:1146359}. When we reached
a stable model, we started modeling the most used operations: git
add, git rm, git commit, git checkot...Such model and such
operations were modeled based on \cite{gitComm}, \cite{progit}, git man
pages and performing tests on \emph{git}. After some operations were
modeled, we checked for some properties, like invariant
preservation, idempotence...\\

When the operations were being modeled many
difficulties were faced due to the lack of precise descriptions. 
Many tests had to be performed to find a general behavior for each
operation. During those tests a bug in git was found. In appendix
\ref{bugappend}, we describe a
sequence of operations to reach a state were information is lost in the
checkout operation. This
bug was reported in the \href{mailto:git@vger.kernel.org}{Git Mailing
List} and by the replies we received many people seemed confused with the
exact operation behavior. First, we received some answers saying it
was the normal behavior and then the \emph{git} maintainer concluded that
it looked like a bug.\\

This report as well as
\href{http://nevrenato.github.com/CSAIL_Git/}{http://nevrenato.github.com/CSAIL\_Git/},
show a detailed description from the work we have done analysing the
model we built. We tried to write it without using Alloy, so
everybody can read it, even if, they have never heard about Alloy.\\

The time we had to work on this project was not enough (not even close) to
go through the whole \emph{git}. Some choices were made trying to
simplify the model and choosing the most important operations. The
model is considered by us, to be stable and ready to be extended with
more operations.\\
